//Variable is a container that stores data values. It is a way to give a name to a value so that we can refer to it later in the program.
let Age = 20; // let is used to declare a variablex
const Name = "Sanam"; // const is used to declare a constant variable
var RollNo = 10; // var is used to declare a variable
console.log(age); 
console.log(Name);
console.log(RollNo);
